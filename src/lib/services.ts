    bodyParagraphs: [
      'Airport transfers are one of our most frequent bookings — early-morning and late-night flights, business travellers who need a punctual pickup, and families arriving with a full set of luggage who want one vehicle instead of splitting into two cabs.',
      'For solo travellers or couples, a sedan (Toyota Etios or Maruti Suzuki Dzire) is the most economical option. Families of five to seven usually prefer the Toyota Innova or Innova Crysta for extra luggage room. Larger groups arriving together — extended families, wedding parties, or corporate teams — can book a Tempo Traveller or Force Urbania van and travel from the airport in one vehicle.',
      'Because Kempegowda Airport is well outside the city core, we recommend booking in advance and sharing your flight number so pickup timing can be adjusted for early landings or delays. Toll charges on the airport road are billed at actuals as per our standard terms.',
